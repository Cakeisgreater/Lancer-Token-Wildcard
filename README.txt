In your world, import the compendiums marked "tw-strikers", "tw-defenders", "tw-controllers", etc. They will be blank, unconfigured actors for legal reasons, as the NPC data and LCPs are property of Massif Press. Add the classes yourself! I would recommend "Quick Insert" to speed up the process.

Now you need to add art. They must be .png files. I would recommend "Retrograde Minis" and their Discord!

Alternatively you can go to [placeholder] for my files.
