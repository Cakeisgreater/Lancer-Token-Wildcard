# Extra Steps
go to ```/data/modules/lancer-token-wildcard.```

Extract "token_wildcard:" to ```/Data/```

done!

**Note:** Don't worry, it's just a bunch of empty folders to serve as directories!


# Other Info:
In your world, import the compendiums marked "tw-strikers", "tw-defenders", "tw-controllers", etc. They will be blank, unconfigured actors for legal reasons, as the NPC data and LCPs are property of Massif Press. Add the classes yourself! I would recommend "[Quick Insert](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/quick-insert)" to speed up the process.

Now you need to add art. They must be .png files. I would recommend "[Retrograde Minis](https://retrogrademinis.com/)" and their Discord!

Alternatively you can go to "https://mega.nz/file/UGcEDDQC#5hxWnFXlLurmcZwJdxdDxF4KQNWFbcX2yF_61JR1tlg" for my files. Just extract this to /Data/ instead of the included empty "token_wildcard.zip" archive. All the artwork is thanks to the wonderful people at the Retrograde Minis Discord! The Assets are derived from Retrograde's wonderful website (linked above).
