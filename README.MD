# Extra Steps
go to ```/data/modules/lancer-token-wildcard.```

Extract "token_wildcard:" to ```/Data/```

done!

**Note:** Don't worry, it's just a bunch of empty folders to serve as directories! It is your job to fill these directories out!


# Other Info (legal?):
In your world, import the compendiums marked "tw-strikers", "tw-defenders", "tw-controllers", etc. They will be blank, unconfigured actors for legal reasons, as the NPC data and LCPs are property of Massif Press. Add the classes yourself! I would recommend "[Quick Insert](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/quick-insert)" to speed up the process.

## Sourcing Token Art:
Now you need to add art. They must be .png files. I would recommend "[Retrograde Minis](https://retrogrademinis.com/)" and their Discord!

Alternatively you can go to "https://mega.nz/file/UGcEDDQC#5hxWnFXlLurmcZwJdxdDxF4KQNWFbcX2yF_61JR1tlg" for my folder, which uses art by the wonderful folks over at the Retrograde Minis Discord Server. Their artwork is in turn derived from the style and assets created by Retrograde! Support their patreon. 

Just extract this file to ```/Data/``` instead of the included empty "token_wildcard.zip" archive.
